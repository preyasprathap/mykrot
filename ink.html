        Hero Motocorp and Gogoro Partner to Build Battery-Swapping Network in India
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Althnough the adosdfdfgption of electric vehicles has been sluggish in India, the country is now making major
        strides in the sector. Following the electric car giant Tesla’s move to enter the untapped market, we have seen
        companies like Ola and even Flipkart announce their plans to bring electric scooters to India. Now, India-based
        automobile maker Hero MotoCorp has partnered with Taiwanese electric scooter company Gogoro to bring the
        latter’s innovative battery-swapping scooters to India. The strategic partnership also aims to create a network
        of battery-swapping stations around the country.<br><br>As per Gogoro’s official blog post, the companies
        decided to join hands to improve the electric scooter landscape in India. It is because, as per Gogoro founder
        and CEO Horace Luke, “no other place on Earth has more people moving around on fossil fuel-burning two-wheelers
        than India.”<br><br>

        As a result, Hero MotoCorp and Gogoro plan to establish a joint venture in India. As part of the deal, Hero will
        manufacture Hero MotoCorp-branded electric scooters based on Gogoro’s creative battery-swapping tech.<br><br>

        Now, for the uninitiated, Gogoro was founded by two former HTC executives almost a decade ago. Since then, the
        company has been developing electric scooters with user-swappable batteries inside.<br><br>

        This means that Gogoro owners, when their scooter runs out of battery, can go to one of the 2,000 battery
        swapping stations that are spread across Taiwan, the company’s home country. At these stations, owners can put
        their discharged battery into a charging dock, which is not bigger than a vending machine, and take out a fully
        charged battery to put it into their scooter. So, the batteries are essentially a public commodity in Gogoro
        scooters.<br><br>
