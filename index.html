    <h1>Nova Bus Completes Altoona Test for 100% Battery-Electric Bus</h1>

    <p>The LFSe+, a long-range, 100 percent battery-electric bus produced by Nova Bus, a member of the Volvo Group, has
        completed the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) bus testing program at the Altoona Bus Testing Center in
        Pennsylvania. Through a series of tests whose outcomes are impartially examined, this stringent evaluation seeks
        to
        guarantee the safety and effectiveness of buses.</p>

    <p> The FTA certification certifies the LFSe+’s dependability while also
        enabling future transit bus purchasers to participate in many US federal
        subsidy programs and adhere to the contractual requirements of
        specific Canadian clients. Nova Bus is now able to take a strategic
        position in the North American market thanks to the successful
        completion of these tests.
        The Saint-Eustache plant in Quebec builds LFSe+ buses for the
        Canadian market, while the Plattsburgh plant in New York State builds
        them for the American market.

    <p>The LFSe+ is a top choice for the switch to sustainable public transportation because of its high autonomy, low
        maintenance costs, and complete removal of any emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.
        Martin Larose, President of Nova Bus, said, “Attaining Altoona certification for our LFSe+ fills us with pride:
        it is one of the
        highest badges of acknowledgment of quality and longevity that our vehicles can acquire.”
        Last year in October, Nova Bus unveiled its new 100% electric, long-range dual charging bus: the LFSe+, at the
        New York
        Public Transit Association conference in Albany, New York.
